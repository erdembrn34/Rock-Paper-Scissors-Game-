# 🪨 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (Python)

This is a simple Python-based implementation of the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game between a user and the computer. The user chooses how many rounds to play, and the game tracks the score after each round and declares a winner at the end.

## 🎮 Game Rules

- `R` = Rock  
- `P` = Paper  
- `S` = Scissors

- Rock beats Scissors  
- Paper beats Rock  
- Scissors beats Paper  
- Same choices result in a **Tie**

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter how many rounds they want to play.
2. In each round, the user inputs their choice (only the first character is taken, so `rock`, `r`, `Ro`, `Rocks` are all valid).
3. The computer randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
4. The winner is determined based on the rules, and the score is updated.
5. After all rounds, the final score is displayed and a winner is declared.
